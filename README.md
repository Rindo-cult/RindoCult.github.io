# Welcome
This is the repository used by the VRChat group [Rindo Cult](https://vrchat.com/home/group/grp_c04c75e4-f49d-482a-a8ac-a43cb6aecdbd).

We handle the funny poster wall and graffiti booster wall from here.

# Website Stuff
We now have a [website](https://rindo-cult.com) (because Azu tends to overcomplicate everything).

More content will be added to the website eventually—but it’s not a priority.
